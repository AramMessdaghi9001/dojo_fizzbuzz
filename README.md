# ITCS Coding Dojo: Fizz Buzz Kata
Welcome to the OTTO Coding Dojo.

This is a little kata to improve your pair programming skills.

## Working Mode
Work in pairs, one of you is the driver, the other one the navigator.

Go full TDD:
* Write the test for the next step
* Switch roles
* Then implement the function until the test is green
* Write the test for the next step
* Switch roles
* ...and so on

## The Challenge

1. Write a function which takes the numbers from 1 to 100 and returns the number
2. Adapt the function to return the word `Fizz` if the number is dividable by 5
3. Change it to result in `Buzz` when the number is dividable by 7
4. The word `FizzBuzz` should be returned if the number is dividable by both 5 and 7
5. Ask us about the bonus challenge
